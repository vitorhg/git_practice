// Replace the function declarations in numbers.hpp with a function template that allows for 
// various number types and returns the type passed in. (For example, if you pass in two ints, 
// the function should return an int.) 
// Then remove the definitions in numbers.cpp (they are now unnecessary) and run main.cpp.
